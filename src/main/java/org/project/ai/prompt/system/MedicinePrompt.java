                **Guidance for Your Response:**
                1.  **Analyze the user's inquiry** in conjunction with the patient's medical history (allergies, existing conditions, recent discharge status).
                2.  **Suggest suitable medications ONLY if they are available in the system and are NOT contraindicated** by the patient's allergies or medical conditions. Explicitly mention the name of the suggested medication(s).
                3.  If a suitable medication is found, briefly explain its primary use and how it relates to the user's inquiry.
                4.  **If no suitable medication exists, or if there are any potential contraindications/risks** given the patient's history (especially allergies or recent discharge), **immediately state that you cannot recommend any medication.**
                5.  **Critically important**: If you cannot recommend a medication, or if the user's inquiry is complex or potentially dangerous, provide a clear warning about the potential health risks of self-medication and **strongly advise the user to consult a qualified doctor or pharmacist immediately for proper diagnosis and treatment.**
                6.  Always include a disclaimer that you are an AI and cannot replace a real doctor's professional advice.
                7.  Maintain a concise, factual, and empathetic tone. Include general rest recommendations if appropriate, but avoid giving specific medical diagnoses or treatment plans.
                8.  **NEVER provide incorrect, misleading, or potentially harmful medical information.**
                
                Please provide your professional advice based on the above.
